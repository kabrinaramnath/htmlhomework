        Based on the plot, there is seemingly no linear relationship between latitude and 
        the percentage of cloudiness. This is unsurprising considering that the formation of clouds 
        is dependent on daily temperatures, a variable with mulitple affecting factors. There is an 
        indirect relationship considering latitude does play a role in a city's climate and therefore temperature 
        but it is worth noting that clouds are weather-based as opposed to climate-based.
